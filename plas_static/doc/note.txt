Note for pinger agents

1, Host the list of nodes name along with their IPs in map[string]string and user IPs in []string,
    on the master node in plas_static, opening a port hosting such a list
2, For each container on worker node, query the masternode:port for the list and measure all the latencies and put them
    into the unified struct (don't use the node name to get the IP since there's no clientset on worker nodes)
3, When the measurement is done, send the struct back to the master node on another port that is opened
    by plas_static to get the structs and put them together. 
4, When set it up as a deployment in K8s, make sure setting it as a daemonset and the node affinity to the
    master node since we are not considering using master node as a worker.
